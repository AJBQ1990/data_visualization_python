# Course on Data Visualization in Python

This repository intends to instruct people on data visualization tools using Python. 

## Data

In this course we will use the following structure to store the data. The main folder where all the data will be stored is in `data/`. This folder will contain all the other subfolders. Within the folder `data/`, there will be other four folders:

- `data/raw/`: This is where raw data is stored.
- `data/interim/`: This is where the data that is already processed but will be further processed is stored.
- `data/external/`: This is where data from external sources is stored.
- `data/processed/`: This is where already processed data is stored and will not change.
